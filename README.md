# Automatic Compression of Convolutional Neural Network Weights

Convolutional Neural Networks in -- todo -- demonstrated it is possible to build architecture with less parameters than then the most used ordinary Neural Networks.
As consequence, it was possible to create even more complex architectures which exhibited better performance, especially in computer vision problems. Later, CNN were employed in other type of problems such as speech recognition and natural language processing.

Despite introduction of transformers in -- todo --, CNN remain to be widely used. Hence, the following works aims to research possibilities of further weight compression, utilizing field of evolutionary algorithms. 
Currently, use of Cartesian Genetic Programming is being researched.

## Install

todo

## Capabilities

As for now, it is possible to approximate single activation map. Compression of multiple activation maps is work in progress.

## Limitations

Program is still not ready to be practically used.

## License

As for now, it is not allowed to use work for any purposes.
